Here you can find some projects/algorithms I have developed 

Projects:
1. <a href="https://github.com/pVlad93/java/tree/master/Project1">Project1</a>
Project for an event with a fixed number of seats, which includes a guest list and a wait list.

Algorithms:
1. <a href="https://github.com/pVlad93/java/tree/master/Algorithms/src/bigNumbers">Big Numbers Sum</a>
Algorithm to compute the sum of two positive integers, represented as an array.
A reason to represent the sum as arrays is to be able to add two numbers that can exceed the size of an int or long.
